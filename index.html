<h3>Cities I have lived in</h3>
I grew up in Texas and lived there for 20 years before joining the Air Force. From there, I went to tech school for 9 months in Vandenberg AFB, CA. Then I went to my first duty station in Minot, ND. Now I live in Cocoa, FL.

<h3>Cities I would like to visit</h3>
I like to visit and take in other cultures. I think visiting Tokyo, Dublin, and New York would be super fun and educational!
